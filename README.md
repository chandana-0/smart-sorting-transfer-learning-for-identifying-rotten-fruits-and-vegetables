This is my project SMART SORTING to Identifying Rotten fruits and Vegetables . 
I enjoy bridging AI with intuitive design through Python, Flask, and modern web technologies.

# ðŸš€ Smart Sorting â€“transfer learning for identifying Rotten Fruit & Vegetable Classification

---
Smart Sorting is a transfer-learning -powered web application that classifies fruits and vegetables as Healthy or Rotten using Transfer Learning (VGG16). It helps reduce food waste and enhance quality control in households, markets, and supply chains.
To automate the sorting process of produce, ensuring faster and more accurate identification of items that are unfit for consumption.
